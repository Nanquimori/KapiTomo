# KapiTomo

KapiTomo is the official site for publishing original works and serving clean data to Nyxalira, Nyxovira, and source plugins.

Website: https://nanquimori.github.io/KapiTomo/

## Work Structure

Novel:

```text
works/my-novel/
|-- work.json
|-- cover.png
`-- chapters/
    |-- chapter-001.json
    `-- chapter-002.json
```

Novel chapter:

```json
{
  "title": "Chapter 01 - The Fall",
  "paragraphs": [
    "First paragraph.",
    "Second paragraph."
  ]
}
```

Comic:

```text
works/my-comic/
|-- work.json
|-- cover.png
`-- chapters/
    `-- chapter-001/
        |-- page-001.png
        `-- page-002.png
```

`work.json` can define title, summary, type, and cover. If it does not exist, the generator uses the folder name and the first cover it finds.

## Generated Output

The generator publishes:

```text
data/works.js
api/works/index.json
api/works/{work}/index.json
api/works/{work}/chapters/{chapter}.json
assets/works/
manga/
plugins/catalog.json
```

Do not edit generated output by hand. Edit `works/` and run the generator again.

## Published Format

Novel content is published inside chapter JSON with `text` and `paragraphs`.

Comic content is published with `pages` and image metadata.

New integrations should use `api/works/index.json`.
